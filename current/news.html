<ul>
<li><p>Example build scripts for supercomputer systems can be found
in src/SampleScripts of the CGNS source code. They include scripts for
building zlib, hdf5 (assuming the user does not already have them
installed system wide) and a script for building CGNS.
All the scripts use autotools; cmake remains untested.</p></li>
<li><p>The Fortran compiler environment variable can now be set with “FC”,
this is the preferred method.</p></li>
<li><p>The Fortran compiler flags can now be set with “FCFLAGS”, this is the
preferred method. If both FFLAGS (which predates FCFLAGS) and FCFLAGS
are set then FCFLAGS is ignored.</p></li>
<li><p>Replaced the hid_t to double (and vice-versa) utilities to_HDF_ID and
to_ADF_ID from a type cast to a function which uses memcpy for the
conversion. This is needed for the upcomming release of HDF5 1.10 where
hid_t was changed from a 32 bit integer to a 64 bit integer.
Should be transparent to user.</p></li>
<li><p>Implemented <span class="xref std std-ref">CPEX 39</span> : To enable with CGNS_ENABLE_BASE_SCOPE</p></li>
<li><p>Implemented <span class="xref std std-ref">CPEX 38</span> : Quadratic Elements for High Order</p></li>
<li><p>In the parallel library, the default parallel input/output mode was
changed from CGP_INDEPENDENT to CGP_COLLECTIVE.</p></li>
<li><p>In the parallel library, a new function was added for passing MPI info
to the CGNS library: cgp_mpi_info (cgp_mpi_info_f).</p></li>
<li><p>In the parallel library, a new parallel example benchmark program,
benchmark_hdf5.c, was added to directory ptests.</p></li>
<li><p>In the parallel library, the cgp_*_read/write_dataset APIs now excepts
non-allocated arrays, or NULL, as valid parameters for the datasets.
Additionally, the dimensional arrays, rmin and rmax, can also be NULL.
If the data array is NULL and the dimensional arrays are not NULL, then
the validity of the dimensional arrays, rmin and rmax, is not checked.
For collective parallel IO, this is used as a mechanism to indicated
that processes with NULL API parameters will not write any data to the
file.</p></li>
<li><p>In the parallel library, cgp_queue_set and cgp_queue_flush were
depreciated in this release.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SUPPORT WAS DROPPED FOR NON-FORTRAN 2003 COMPLIANT COMPILERS.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Configure was changed to check if the Fortran compiler is Fortran 2003
compliant.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Fortran library, the predefined CGNS constant parameters data
types were changed from INTEGER to ENUM, BIND(C) for better C
interoperability. The users should use the predefined constants whenever
possible and not the numerical value represented by the constants.
A variable expecting an enum value returned from a Fortran API should
be declared, INTEGER(cgenum_t).</p></li>
<li><p>In the Fortran library, INCLUDE “cgnslib_f.h” was removed in favor of
using a module, USE CGNS. This allows defining a KIND type for
integers instead of the current way of using the preprocessor dependent
cgsize_t. The user should be sure to declare the arguments declared int
in the C APIs as INTEGER in Fortran. The ONLY Fortran arguments declared
as type cgsize_t should be the arguments which are also declared cgsize_t
in the C APIs. This is very important when building with
option –enable-64bit. The test programs were updated in order
to conform to this convention.
Assuming the rules in step [enu:int64] were followed, users should not
need to use parameter CG_BUILD_64BIT since Fortran’s cgsize_t is now
guaranteed to match C’s cgsize_t.
Fortran programs defining CGNS data types with a default INTEGER size
of 8 bytes also then need to compile the CGNS library with the default
INTEGER size of 8 bytes. This is independent of whether or
not –enable-64bit is being used. For clarification,
using –enable-64bit allows for data types (i.e. those declared
as cgsize_t) to be able to store values which are too large to be stored
as 4 byte integers (i.e. numbers greater than 2,147,483,647).
It is not necessary, or advisable (since it waste memory),
to have CGNS INTEGER types (types declared int in C) to be 8 bytes;
the variables declared as cgsize_t will automatically handle data types
that can not be stored as 4 byte integers when –enable-64bit
is being used. If the CGNS library was not compiled
with a default INTEGER of 8 bytes, but the calling program was,
then all integers passed to CGNS with C type int should
be declared INTEGER(C_INT).
A new Fortran API was added for determining the CGNS data type of a
variable which is interoperable with the C data type.</p>

done, since this may interfere with parallel I/O. This may be reenabled
within an application with the cg_set_compress function, or done later
through the CGNSview GUI or with the cgnscompress program in the tools
subdirectory. Conversion programs to and from AFLR3, FAST, and TetGen
have also been added to CGNStools.</p></li>

defines MODE_xxx, Null, and UserDefined. For example, MODE_READ is

currently supported. Support has been added to build the cgns library
as a DLL under Windows. The NormalIndex arguments to cg_boco_info,
cg_boco_normal_write are now optional (pass as 0 or NULL to ignore).</p></li>
<li><p>Moved some of the CGNS utility programs, such as cgnscheck, to the

number from 2.42 to 2.46, and some minor bug fixes). The last digit on
the version number is now ignored when reporting that a file was created
with a newer version than the current library. Finally, in cgnstools,
changed cgnsplot to use a tree layout instead of lists, and added a

bug in cgns_interpolate which was causing that program to work
incorrectly or crash. Also added a VTK file export routine for CGNS files.</p></li>

<p class="topic-title">October 5, 2006: Version 2.5 (beta) of the CGNS library has been released (cgnslib_2.5-1.tar.gz).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This fixes problems with partial read and writes, and adds some
additional capabilities (goto operation enhancements, type names,
new cgns file checker, setting path to search for links, and
new routine for configuring CGNS). Documentation is not available yet.
Look in the “tests” subdirectory at “test_partial.c” and “test_goto.c”
for examples of the use of these routines. In addition, there are 2 other
new releases for download from SourceForge:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>cgnslib_2.4-5.tar.gz:
This release fixes some problems with ADF on Windows 64 bit machines,
and adds a -64 option to the configure.bat file.</p></li>
<li><p>cgnstools-2-5-1.tar.gz: Adds support for CGNS version 2.5.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Configures the Tcl/Tk GUI to use the current color scheme rather
than a “Windows” type color scheme. Fixes some minor bugs and adds some
improvement to the cgnscheck program. Allows reading of both HDF5 and
ADF - based CGNS files (requires the adf2hdf and hdf2adf
convertor programs).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic-title">Spring, 2006:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are two special CGNS “events” planned for the American Institute
of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) meeting being
held 5-8 June 2006 in San Francisco.
The first is a Panel discussion, tentatively
titled “CGNS Practical Applications in CFD”. This will occur during
the regular AIAA sessions at the conference.
The second is a “CGNS Tutorial Session”, currently scheduled for Wednsday,
7 June 2006 in the evening. This session will be conducted in two parts:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Basic usage of CGNS (including examples for structured
and unstructured grids), and</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced topics (tentatively including HDF-5 usage, parallel
implementation, and SIDS high level representation).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The tutorial session will be taught by five experienced
users/developers of CGNS and will be a great way to either
get a basic introduction or to refine your knowledge of CGNS.
Note that AIAA charges a registration fee for conference attendance,
but there is no additional fee to attend the CGNS events. More information
about the AIAA conference can be found at: www.aiaa.org.

<li><p>This is the final release for Version 2.3 - Version 2.4 is now
the official version. The CGNS library releases fixed a bug
in cg_family_write and others where the wrong file (when multiple are open)
might be accessed or a segfault occur. Added unstructured mesh rind
to Version 2.4, and support for that in CGNSplot and cgnscheck.
Improved the Fortran to C interface, particularly under Windows,
Also fixed some minor bugs in the CGNStools and improved
the cgnscheck program.</p></li>

In the GridConnectivity node figure in both the SIDS-to-ADF and SIDS-to-HDF File Mapping Manual, changed the Cardinality of CellListDonor/PointListDonor from “1” to “0,1”.
Added the function cg_conn_write_short in the Mid-Level Library Manual, to write generalized zone connectivity data without donor information.
In the SIDS document, added a sentence to the description of ElementRange for the Elements_t structure to clarify the use of the global numbering system.
