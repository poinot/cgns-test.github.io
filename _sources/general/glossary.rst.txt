    Sphinx
      **Sphinx** is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent

      Python documentation, and it has excellent facilities for the
      documentation of software projects in a range of languages.

    ReST

      It makes the work of writers easier by delegating most of the
      rendering commands and options to generators such as :term:`Sphinx`.
