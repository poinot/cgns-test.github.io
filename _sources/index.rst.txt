===========================
	   
The **CFD General Notation System** (CGNS) provides a general, portable,
and extensible standard for the storage and retrieval of computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis data.  It consists of a collection of
conventions, and free and open software implementing those
conventions. It is self-descriptive, machine-independent,
well-documented, and administered by an international steering
committee.
     
It is also an :ref:`American Institute of Aeronautics and
Astronautics (AIAA) Recommended Practice <AIAAPractice>`.
The system consists of two
parts: (1) a standard data model and mapping format for recording the
data, and (2) software that reads, writes, and modifies data in that
format.  The format is a conceptual entity established by the
documentation; the software is a physical product supplied to enable
developers to access and produce data recorded in that format.

The CGNS system is designed to facilitate the exchange of data between
sites and applications, and to help stabilize the archiving of
aerodynamic data.  The data are stored in a compact, binary format and
are accessible through a complete and extensible library of functions.
The API (Application Program Interface) is platform independent and
can be easily implemented in C, C++, Fortran and Fortran90
applications.
