.. _AIAAPractice:

The AIAA recommanded practice
-----------------------------

As part of its role as a sub-committee of
the :term:`AIAA` `CFD Committee on Standards 
<https://aiaa.org/get-involved/committees-groups/AIAA-Committees-on-Standards>`_
the *CGNS Steering Committee* was involved in the development of the
*AIAA Recommended Practice* for recording and recovering computer
data associated with the numerical solution of the equations of
fluid dynamics. The Recommended Practice consists of the CGNS
Standard Interface Data Structures (SIDS) document, reformatted to
conform to :term:`AIAA`'s requirements.

Although outdated, the current :term:`AIAA` Recommended Practice
(corresponding to CGNS Version 2.4) is available as an outdated
PDF file (1.01M, 200 pages; copyright :term:`AIAA`,
made available here by permission).

ISO Step initiative
-------------------

Between 1999 and 2002, an effort was spearheaded by Boeing to establish an ISO-STEP standard for the representation, storage, and exchange of digital data in fluid dynamics based on the CGNS standard.
Unfortunately, the effort had to be curtailed because of budget problems.
It was subsequently decided that an existing ISO standard on finite element solid mechanics would be rewritten and submitted to include CGNS as well as an integrated engineering analysis framework.
Some details on this subsequent effort can be found in archives of the :ref:`Meeting and Telecon Minutes <DocMinutes>`. This new ISO effort was being conducted completely outside of the control of the CGNS committee.
Therefore, the current status is not known.
