.. _AIAAPractice:

The AIAA recommanded practice
-----------------------------

As part of its role as a sub-committee of
the :term:`AIAA` `CFD Committee on Standards 
<https://aiaa.org/get-involved/committees-groups/AIAA-Committees-on-Standards>`_
the *CGNS Steering Committee* was involved in the development of the
*AIAA Recommended Practice* for recording and recovering computer
data associated with the numerical solution of the equations of
fluid dynamics. The Recommended Practice consists of the CGNS
Standard Interface Data Structures (SIDS) document, reformatted to
conform to :term:`AIAA`'s requirements.

Although outdated, the current :term:`AIAA` Recommended Practice
(corresponding to CGNS Version 2.4) is available as an outdated
PDF file (1.01M, 200 pages; copyright :term:`AIAA`,
made available here by permission).
