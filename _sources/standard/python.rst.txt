CGNS/Python - A Python implementation
=====================================

The CGNS/Python mapping defines a tree structure composed of nodes implemented for the `Python programming langage <https://www.python.org/>`_.
A special links structure is also defined for a correct mapping of the management of files on the disk.
The mapping presented here is **not** a library, it is the lowest possible correspondance between a :ref:`CGNS/SIDS<CGNS-SIDS>` structure and a Python representation.
This specification is public and can be used as the basis for Python based CGNS application interoperability.
Python is an interpreted langage and it has a textual representation of its objects, this representation can be used for CGNS/Python trees as well.

The python documentation is not up-to-date (v3.1.2).

Currently the documentation is only available as a PDF file:
:download:`SIDS-to-Python(PDF)<../../python/sidstopython.pdf>`
