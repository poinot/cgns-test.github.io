           Plot3dg_to_CGNS external link	  	Converts a "standard" Plot3D grid file to a CGNS grid file.

   CGNS_to_Plot3d external link		Converts a CGNS file with a cell-centered solution to "standard" Plot3D grid and solution files.

   CGNS_readhist external link		Reads a CGNS file and writes history data to a formatted file.

   FTU external link		Converts CGNS files to and from Plot3D format. Has a text-based menu allowing the manipulation of a CGNS base.
   Contact: Bob Bush (bushrh@pweh.com)

   CGNSview external link		A CGNS file viewer and editor; requires Tcl/Tk 8.3 or above. The GUI allows complete editing of CGNS files (both ADF and HDF5), and handles links and data conversions. It works at the CGIO interface level, and thus is not affected by "bad" CGNS files. It includes built-in CGNS node and label information, and documentation support through HTML (including access to all CGNS docs).

   CGNS Tools external link		A variety of tools for viewing, editing, and manipulating the contents of CGNS files; requires Tcl/Tk 8.3 or above. Included are:
   CGNSplot, for plotting grids
   CGNScalc, a calculator using data in CGNS files
   Utilities for converting from Patran, and from/to PLOT3D and Tecplot
   Utilities for modifying the grid location (vertex or cell-center), solution variables (primitive or conservative), and data class (Dimensional, NormalizedByDimensional, or NormalizedByUnknownDimensional)
   Utilities for creating a subset or interpolated version of a CGNS file
   These may be used as stand-alone utilities, or initiated from CGNSview, which is included.
